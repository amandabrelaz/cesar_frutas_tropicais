# cesar_frutas_tropicais
Android application with two activities, in the first one, a list with all tropical fruits and vegs available on this API(only fruit or veg name is  
needed in this screen) and a search box, so if the user types in the search box the results are filtered on the list. The second activity shows a  
detailed(name, bot names, other names, image, and description) screen of each fruit clicked by used in the first screen, doing a request to  
http://api.tropicalfruitandveg.com/tfvjsonapi.php?tfvitem=<item name> changing <item_name> by a fruit or a veg name (e.g.  
http://api.tropicalfruitandveg.com/tfvjsonapi.php?tfvitem=banana).
